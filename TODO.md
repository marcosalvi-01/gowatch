# bugs:

- fix watched layout on mobile being too wide (making the sidebar too wide too)
- fix the width of the action buttons in the movie details sometimes being bigger or smaller, use a fixed width
- update the add to list button after creating a list

# feats:

- add section in a movie details to see in which lists it already is
- support people in the search

# optimizations:

- the watched call takes around 120 ms for 1200 movies, use pagination?
