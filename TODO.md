# bugs:

- sometimes if the connection is slow switching the page using the menu on the left doesn't select the correct page

# feats:

- add section in a movie details to see in which lists it already is
- support people in the search
- multiple users
- stats page

# optimizations:

- the watched call takes around 120 ms for 1200 movies, use pagination?
